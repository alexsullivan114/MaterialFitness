 * Created by Alex Sullivan on 11/1/2015.
 *
 * This is a blank base presenter - basically just something for other presenters to extend.
 *
 * I mostly wanted this hear because I'm sure I'll run into situations where we want some type
 * of functionality that's common to all presenters. Maybe detachedFromView logic, or something
 * along those lines.
